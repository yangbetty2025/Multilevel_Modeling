# What are multilevel models?
Some data have a **hierarchical** or **clustered** structure. For example, children who grew up in the same households with the same parents tend to be more alike than random individuals from the same age groups. <br>
<br>
Similarly, students from the same school or neighborhoods may perform more similarly on standardized tests. In this case, individual students' test scores are considered "nested" within institutions or geographical areas. <br>
